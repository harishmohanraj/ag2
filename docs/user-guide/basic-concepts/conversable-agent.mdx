### GitHub Codespaces

Before we jump into some code, each code block will have a button that opens it in GitHub Codespaces so you can start playing with AG2 inside a fully configured environment.

Add an `OPENAI_API_KEY` secret to your GitHub Codespaces so your agents can use an LLM. See the [instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-your-codespaces/managing-your-account-specific-secrets-for-github-codespaces).

If you want to run it on your machine, just follow the previous installing AG2 and LLM configuration steps.

# Say hello to ConversableAgent

ConversableAgent is at the heart of all AG2 agents while also being a fully functioning agent.

Let's *converse* with ConversableAgent in just 4 simple steps.

import Example from "/snippets/python-examples/conversableagentchat.mdx";

<Example/>

Let's break it down:

1. Import `ConversableAgent`, you'll find the most popular classes available directly from `autogen`.

2. Create our LLM configuration to define the LLM that our agent will use.

3. Create our ConversableAgent give them a unique name, and use `system_message` to define their purpose.

4. Chat with the agent using their `run` method, passing in our starting message.

    ```console
    human (to helpful_agent):

    In one sentence, what's the big deal about AI?

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    >>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...
    helpful_agent (to human):

    AIâ€™s a marvel that transforms the mundane,
    Empowering minds, making tasks less a strain.
